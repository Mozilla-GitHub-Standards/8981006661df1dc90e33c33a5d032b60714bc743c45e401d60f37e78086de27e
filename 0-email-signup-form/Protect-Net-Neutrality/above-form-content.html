          Dear Member of Congress,
        </p>
        <p>
          The Federal Communications Commissioners will take a vote February 26th on net neutrality rules. I want the FCC to do all it can and put strong protections in place. I expect you to do the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          As American citizens, we have been clear about what we want. To date, the public commented nearly four million times demanding that the FCC support full net neutrality. More than 300,000 of those comments were by phone — at one point reaching 1,000 calls per minute.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clearly I am not alone in my belief that the Web is a global engine of innovation and entrepreneurship — a level playing field from which we can learn, connect and create. I stand with the millions of others in the global Web community that have opposed fast lanes which leave the majority in the slow lane, restricting freedom of choice online. There should be no blocking and discrimination of content online. If the FCC votes to uphold these protections, I am asking you to stand in support of full protections, and to leave a legacy that will ensure a free and open Web for generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sincerely, <br/>
          <i>Your name will go here</i>

        <h2>The Fight to Protect Net Neutrality</h2>
        <p>
          We are so close to victory after a long, sustained fight to get strong, effective protections for net neutrality. <b>The Federal Communications Commission is slated to vote on net neutrality rules on February 26th. Time is running out for us to speak out. That is why it is so important for every American to call or write their member of Congress now.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Momentum has been on our side, but the handful of powerful companies are pulling out all the stops between now and the FCC’s vote. The corporate Goliaths and their lobbyists are using their influence to get politicians to gut net neutrality as we know it and undermine the open nature of the Web. Don’t let them do this.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re so close to victory, but we’re not there yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The biggest weapon we have in the fight for net neutrality is you. Will you make a last stand with us to make sure the FCC votes for strong net neutrality protections?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ll make sure to send your message — along with those of everyone else who speaks out — directly to members of Congress. Let’s protect the open Internet for all.
