<h1>Tell U.S. Congress:<br />Protect Net Neutrality</h1>
<div class="ws_col1" style="margin-bottom: 25px;">

  <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #F5FAFE; border-color: #d7d3cb; border-style: solid; border-bottom-left-radius: 7px; border-bottom-right-radius: 7px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-top-left-radius: 7px; border-top-right-radius: 7px; border-top-width: 3px;">
    <p>Dear Congress,</p>

    <p>As an American and member of the global Web community, I urge you to take the necessary steps to protect Net Neutrality.</p>

    <p>The Web was made to be a global engine of innovation and entrepreneurship &mdash; a level playing field from which we could learn, connect and create. The FCC's most recent rule proposal, which would allow large companies or others to buy faster and more direct Internet access, threatens that level playing field and the open Web as we know it.</p>

    <p><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/files/2014/05/Mozilla-Petition.pdf" target="_blank">Mozilla has outlined a clear solution giving the FCC authority to protect Net Neutrality</a>, and Congress should make sure the FCC enacts rules that protect all users of the Internet from discrimination.</p>

    <p>I hope you'll do the right thing and support Mozilla's solution to protect Net Neutrality.</p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Your name here</p>
  </div> <br />

  <p>As of now, the Internet preserves our right to access all lawful content and software without interference. In other words, the Web is a level playing field: you can read, watch, play, browse and share on the same terms as everybody else.</p>

  <p>That level playing field &mdash; or "Net Neutrality" &mdash; is under threat.  If we stand by, the Internet could become increasingly closed, centrally controlled and designed to serve the few instead of the many. It's up to us to protect the open Web.</p>

  <p>That's where you come in. Now more than ever, we need to come together as a community, with a unified voice and solution, to protect the world's largest public resource. It's up to Congress through its oversight authority to make sure the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) adopts rules to keep the Internet accessible to everyone. Mozilla needs your voice to make that happen.</p>

  <p>Mozilla already submitted a letter to the FCC that explains our support for Net Neutrality and why U.S. leaders must enact real authority to maintain it. <strong>The FCC is presenting Mozilla's proposal for comment &mdash; which is a BIG step, but we need to make sure Congress follows through. Will you add your name to make sure Congress supports Mozilla's call for real authority to protect Net Neutrality?</strong></p>

  <p>We'll make sure to deliver your signature &mdash; along with those of everyone who signs &mdash; directly to members of Congress. And we'll never stop fighting for an open Web.</p>
