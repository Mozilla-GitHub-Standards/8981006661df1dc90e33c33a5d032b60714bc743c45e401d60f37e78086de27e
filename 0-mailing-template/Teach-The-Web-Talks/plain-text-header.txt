TEACH THE WEB Talk
******************

Hello,

Interested in learning more about building and
developing community online?

Join us on December 18th for "Starting From
Scratch: The Basics of Building An Online Community", the second
installment of the Teach The Web Talks series where we bring
together outstanding individuals to give educational talks on a
wide range of subjects pertaining to web literacy development and
education.

These talks are all about learning, sharing,
and improving skills to make us better teachers and mentors of
the web.

We look forward to connecting with you on
Thursday,

Lucy
